# Second-_hand_car_price_indicator
A second car price indicator is a tool or service that helps you determine the current market value of a used car. It typically takes into account various factors such as the car’s make, model, year, mileage, condition, and location to provide an estimated price range. This information can be invaluable for both buyers and sellers in the used car market to ensure fair pricing

When analyzing the car.csv file, it’s crucial to address several data quality issues to ensure accurate analysis:
Year Field: The ‘year’ column should contain only year values. Non-year values need to be identified and corrected or removed.
Price Field: The ‘price’ column should ideally contain integer values representing the cost of the car. Non-integer values must be converted or treated as data entry errors.
Kilometer Field: If the ‘km’ field is not required for analysis, it should be removed to simplify the dataset.
Fuel Type Field: The ‘fuel type’ column contains NaN values, which represent missing data. These should be handled appropriately, either by filling them with a default value, using a data imputation technique, or removing the entries.
Each of these points highlights a common data cleaning task that is essential for preparing your dataset for further analysis, such as statistical modeling or machine learning. Ensuring data quality is a fundamental step in the data analysis process.
